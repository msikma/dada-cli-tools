# Dada CLI Tools

A set of libraries for making CLI tools. This package was made for my personal purposes, not for usage by a general public, which is why there's very little documentation. You can use this if you want, but I suggest you don't because I'm going to be breaking it regularly.

Used in conjunction with [create-dada-cli](https://github.com/msikma/create-dada-cli) for quickly bootstrapping new CLI projects.
